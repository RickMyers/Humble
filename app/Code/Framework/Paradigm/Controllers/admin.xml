Administration App Controller

Defines the initial actions for the tools/apps you want to use from the administrator section.

Every module gets one default app, but you can define as many as you want for your toolset


For Controller reference, please see "Anatomy of a Controller" at https://humbleprogramming.com/pages/Controllers.htmls
