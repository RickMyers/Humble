/*
 * Your JavaScript code will receive an object called EVENT.  Any event fields will be in the form of EVENT.<field>, such as EVENT.namespace
 * 
 * Anything you want to change or attach to the EVENT, just do so like EVENT.myfield = myvalue;
 * 
 * At the conclusion of this code, the EVENT object will be returned to the calling workflow (PHP)
 * 
 * Good Luck!
