    <b>Reason for Creation</b>:<br /><br />
    I've been creating medical web forms for physicians for more than 10 years, with the primary target being Pads and PCs.  Some of the physicians who were using various models of pads were reporting
    weird behavior, but I couldn't recreate it on PC.  These days you'd probably just do a zoom call to see what they are seeing, but that wasn't available.  Instead I wanted them to take a screenshot
    and send that to me, but to make it even easier I created this bit of code below which captures a screen shot and attaches it as a normal form element for submission.  It does this by accessing the 
    screen shot in the memory buffer, base 64 convert the binary data, and attach that as normal a text element.  I actually looked online for an example of someone doing this but didn't find anyone so
    this appears to be novel coding.  It worked perfectly at the time, and we were able to figure it was some HTML5 introduced tags that did not render properly on some models of pads.
